# Introduction

## What is Vue.js?

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like **view**) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with [modern tooling](single-file-components.html) and [supporting libraries](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#components--libraries).

If you’d like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we <a id="modal-player"  href="#">created a video</a> walking through the core principles and a sample project.

If you are an experienced frontend developer and want to know how Vue compares to other libraries/frameworks, check out the [Comparison with Other Frameworks](comparison.html).

## Getting Started

<a class="button" href="installation.html">Installation</a>

::: tip 
The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the [JSFiddle Hello World example](https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/50wL7mdz/). Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chrisvfritz/7f8d7d63000b48493c336e48b3db3e52/raw/ed60c4e5d5c6fec48b0921edaed0cb60be30e87c/index.html" target="_blank" download="index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an <code>index.html</code> file</a> and include Vue with:

``` html
<!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

or:

``` html
<!-- production version, optimized for size and speed -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
```

The [Installation](installation.md) page provides more options of installing Vue. Note: We **do not** recommend that beginners start with `vue-cli`, especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.

If you prefer something more interactive, you can also check out [this tutorial series on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/gvuedocs), which gives you a mix of screencast and code playground that you can pause and play around with anytime.

## Declarative Rendering

At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively render data to the DOM using straightforward template syntax:

``` html
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>
```
``` js
const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  }
})
```
<intro-1 />

We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a string template, but Vue has done a lot of work under the hood. The data and the DOM are now linked, and everything is now **reactive**. How do we know? Change the `message` property in the code snippet below to a different value. You the rendered example update accordingly: ![placeholder sandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/s/xenodochial-meninsky-rxlt4)

In addition to text interpolation, we can also bind element attributes like this:

``` html
<div id="app-2">
  <span v-bind:title="message">
    Hover your mouse over me for a few seconds
    to see my dynamically bound title!
  </span>
</div>
```
``` js
const app2 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-2',
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'You loaded this page on ' + new Date().toLocaleString()
    }
  }
})
```
<intro-2 />
Here we are encountering something new. The `v-bind` attribute you are seeing is called a **directive**. Directives are prefixed with `v-` to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is basically saying "keep this element's `title` attribute up-to-date with the `message` property on the Vue instance."

## Conditionals and Loops

It's easy to toggle the presence of an element, too:

``` html
<div id="app-3">
  <span v-if="seen">Now you see me</span>
</div>
```
<intro-3/>

This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, but also the **structure** of the DOM. Moreover, Vue also provides a powerful transition effect system that can automatically apply [transition effects](TODO) when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue.

You can change `seen` from `true` to `false` in the sandbox below to check the effect: https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-conditional-rendering-eptpp

There are quite a few other directives, each with its own special functionality. For example, the `v-for` directive can be used for displaying a list of items using the data from an Array:

``` html
<div id="app-4">
  <ol>
    <li v-for="todo in todos">
      {{ todo.text }}
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
```
``` js
const app4 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-4',
  data() {
    return {
      todos: [
        { text: 'Learn JavaScript' },
        { text: 'Learn Vue' },
        { text: 'Build something awesome' }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```
<intro-4/>

## Handling User Input

To let users interact with your app, we can use the `v-on` directive to attach event listeners that invoke methods on our Vue instances:

``` html
<div id="app-5">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
  <button v-on:click="reverseMessage">Reverse Message</button>
</div>
```
``` js
constapp5 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-5',
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello Vue.js!'
    }
  },
  methods: {
    reverseMessage() {
      this.message = this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```
<intro-5/>

Note that in this method we update the state of our app without touching the DOM - all DOM manipulations are handled by Vue, and the code you write is focused on the underlying logic.

Vue also provides the `v-model` directive that makes two-way binding between form input and app state a breeze:

``` html
<div id="app-6">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
  <input v-model="message">
</div>
```
``` js
var app6 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-6',
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  }
})
```
