# Let's Get Started

Welcome to the Vue tutorial!

Before we begin, we highly recommend reading the [Introduction](/guide/introduction.html) if you haven't done so yet. It gives you a high-level overview of what Vue is about.

You can choose your [preferred API style](/guide/introduction.html#api-styles) using the switches above. You can also toggle between the styles at any time.

The goal of this tutorial is to quickly give you an experience of what it feels like to work with Vue, right in the browser. It will not cover every aspect of the framework - we do that in the [Guide](/guide/quick-start.html).

You can edit the demo code and see the result update instantly. Each step will introduce a core feature of Vue, and you will be expected to complete the code to get the demo working. If you get stuck, you will have a "Show me!" button that reveals the working code for you. Try not to rely on it too much - you'll learn faster by figuring things out on your own.

If you are ready, click "Next" to get started.
