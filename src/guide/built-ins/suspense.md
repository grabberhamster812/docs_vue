# Suspense

## Basic Usage

### `async setup()`

### Async Components

Async components are _suspensible_ by default. This means if it has a `<Suspense>` in the parent chain, it will be treated as an async dependency of that `<Suspense>`. In this case, the loading state will be controlled by the `<Suspense>`, and the component's own loading, error, delay and timeout options will be ignored.

The async component can opt-out of `Suspense` control and let the component always control its own loading state by specifying `suspensible: false` in its options.
