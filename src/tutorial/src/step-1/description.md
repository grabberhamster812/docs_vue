# Getting Started

Welcome to the Vue tutorial! Before we begin, please read the [Introduction](/guide/introduction.html) if you haven't done so yet. It gives you a high-level overview of what Vue is about.

The goal of this tutorial is to quickly give you an experience of what it feels like to work with Vue, right in the browser. It does **not** aim to be comprehensive, so after you complete it, make sure to also read the [Guide](/guide/quick-start.html) which covers each topic in more details.

You can edit the code <span class="wide">on the right</span><span class="narrow">below</span> and see the result update instantly. Each step will introduce a core feature of Vue, and you will be expected to complete the code to get the demo working. If you get stuck, you will have a "Show me!" button that reveals the working code for you. Try not to rely on it too much - you'll learn faster by figuring things out on your own.

You can choose your preferred [API style](/guide/introduction.html#api-styles) using the **API Preference** switches at the top. You can switch between styles any time your like, but beware that the code will be reset when you do so.
